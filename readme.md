# DSA with Java

“DSA with Java: where logic meets pain and semicolons decide your fate.”

## Topics Covered
- Arrays (1D, 2D, and Multidimensional — because one dimension wasn’t painful enough)

## Future Topics
- ArrayList
- Strings 
- LinkedList, Stack, Queue
- ...and many more (depending on how much pain I can handle)

## How I’m Learning
By writing code, breaking code, fixing code, and wondering why I ever started DSA.

## Goal
To master DSA before DSA masters me.  
If you see no new commits... assume the DSA topics finally won.
